Okay, so I just finished watching The Parenting, and oh my god, it's like a roller coaster of emotions, but more like one of those janky ones where you think it might break at any second, you know? I'm just sitting there thinking, “Why are these characters making such weird choices?!” Like, seriously, sometimes I just wanted to scream, “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” But, like, in a good way — keeps you on your toes. 

Anyway, I’m chatting with my buddy, and we’re laughing about how if our parents did half of the stuff in that movie, we'd probably grow up thinking the world’s a circus. But maybe it is a circus, so who knows? 

>The dialogue's all over the place, and some of the kid's comebacks are gold, man, just pure comedy gold. Although, there're these moments where you're just sat there, popcorn halfway to your mouth, thinking, Did that really just happen? Like, it's so out of left field sometimes. But hey, isn't that life?

I thought about hitting you up earlier to download the movie and see what the fuss is about before the spoilers started flying. And let me tell you, there are some plot twists that you see a mile away and some that just smack you in the face. 

Sooo, do you remember that one actor? Totally nailed it. Others, though... hmmm, let's just say, maybe they should stick to commercials, lol. But that's part of the charm, right? Makes it feel kinda raw, kinda 'real' in its own silly way. And those music choices? I was like, “Did they pull this from a high school garage band?” Seriously.

Oh, quick tangent – side characters are funnier than the main ones half the time. Like, they probably should have made a movie just about them! Can we get a sequel on that? Haha, but no kidding, I'm turning into one of those people who can't stop watching bad movies, you know?

So, basically, what I’m saying is, if you’re down for a weirdly good time, watch the movie. It’s not Oscar material, but it’s got this vibe where it just embraces its own chaos. Kinda like life, I guess. Alright, enough rambling. Hit me up if you catch it, I wanna hear your hot takes!
